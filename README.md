# JavaFX Assignments

This repository contains two JavaFX assignments that showcase different functionalities. The first assignment is a calculator application with both factorial and car loan interest calculations, and the second assignment is a student information system.

## Assignment 1: Calculator Application

### Description

This application consists of two main functionalities:

1. **Factorial Calculation**: This section allows users to calculate the factorial of a number asynchronously.
2. **Car Loan Interest Calculation**: This section calculates the interest for a car loan based on the loan amount, interest rate, and duration.

### Files

- `Calculator.fxml`: FXML layout file for the calculator application.
- `CarLoanTask.java`: Java class for calculating car loan interest in a separate task.
- `Controller.java`: Java class for handling user interactions in the calculator application.
- `FactorialTask.java`: Java class for calculating factorial in a separate task.
- `Main.java`: Java class to launch the calculator application.


## Assignment 2: Student Information System

### Description

This application collects and displays student information. Users can input personal details, select activities, choose a major, and select subjects. The application validates phone numbers, postal codes, and email addresses before displaying the information.

### Files

- `StudentInformationSystem.java`: Java class to launch the student information system application.
- `StudentInformationSystemController.java`: Java class for handling user interactions and data validation in the student information system.
- `StudentInformationSystem.fxml`: FXML layout file for the student information system application.
